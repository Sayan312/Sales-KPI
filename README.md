# Sales-KPI
Objective:
. Producing an Excel Dashboard representing Sales Performance through Key Indicators across various parameters.
Steps:
. We take the raw sales data and apply vlookup on the basis of the customer ids and codes that links the sales page to the customers , regions table .
. After doing the vlookup we copy and paste by values of the excel table on a new sheet so that the columns are not interdependent and we can work on them individually.
. We then create pivot table and display various parameters along with pivot charts and make them interpretable.
. We then copy those charts and paste them in a new dashboard page and apply slicers for getting actionable insights on key indicators.
