# Sales-KPI

Objective:

. Producing an Excel Dashboard representing Sales Performance through Key Indicators across various parameters.

Steps:
1. We take the raw sales data and apply vlookup on the basis of the customer ids and codes that links the sales page to the customers , regions table .

2. We create a Total Price by multiplying the order quantity with Unit Price and Total Profit column by subtracting the Cost column from the Total Price column to give further insights into the data at hand. 

3. After doing the vlookup we copy and paste by values of the excel table on a new sheet so that the columns are not interdependent and we can work on them individually.

4. We then create pivot table and display various parameters along with pivot charts and make them interpretable.

5. We then copy those charts and paste them in a new dashboard page and apply slicers for getting actionable insights on key indicators.
